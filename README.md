# mock_CFG_assignment_repo

For people submitting your assignment week as an individual by github, please be sure to have a github repository which is created for submitting all your assignments. Then inside that repository you have a folder for each assignment. See this repo of mine as an example. Then invite your marker as a collaborator to your repo.

Whilst this repo is public for demonstration purposes, your repo should be private with your assignment marker invited as a collaborator.

For each new assignment you should create a new folder, put your homework in that folder, commit and then push.

N.B. There is no actual homework inside this repo!
