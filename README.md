# mock_CFG_assignment_repo
This repo is hosted to demonstrate how students should submit their assignments by github

Whilst this repo is public for demonstration purposes, your repo should be private with your assignment marker invited as a collaborator.

For each new assignment you should create a new folder, put your homework in that folder, commit and then push.

N.B. There is no actual homework inside this repo!
